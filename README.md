# Diabetes-Prediction
The Following project uses Decision Tree Classifier algorithm to predict whether a person has diabetes or not.
Train test split method has been used to train the model on the training data and and make predictions on the testing data .
OneHotEncoding has been used to convert the categorical columns into numerical columns.
Standardscaler has been used to scale down the values between range [-1 to 1] for the better prediction of the model.
Pipeline feature is used to combine all the data as output of each step is used as input of next step.
checked accuracy of the model on the training and as well as testing data and also used cross val score to avoid the overfitting problem .
